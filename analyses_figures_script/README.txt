Folder "analyses_figures_script" encompasses all codes to perform the analyses and figures. There are four different R scripts


* nestling_condition.R contains codes to perform the models related to the analyses correlating nestling body condition to parasite load
along with codes to 
- Table 1 (outputs of the models for mass and tarsus length), 
- Figure 2 (linear relation between mass and relative parasite load),
- and Table S1 (outputs of the models when excluding non-significant interactions)

* recruit_color.R contains codes to perform the models related to the analyses correlating plumage colour of yearling breeder to their parasite load as a nestling (prediction 1)
along with codes to 
- Table 2 (outputs of the models for all five color variables), 
- Figure 3 (linear relation between brightness of the yellow patch and relative parasite load, for small and large broods),
- and Table S2 (outputs of the models when excluding non-significant interactions)

* adult_color.R contains codes to perform the models related to the analyses correlating plumage colour of adult breeder to the parasite load of their former brood (as parents) (prediction 2)
along with codes to 
- Table 3 (outputs of the models for all five color variables), 
- Figure 4 (linear relation between UV chroma of the blue crown and relative parasite load for female and male),
- Figure 5 (linear relation between brightness of the yellow patch and relative parasite load),
- and Table S3 (outputs of the models when excluding non-significant interactions)

* additional_ESM.R contains additional codes to perform figures and tables found in supplementary materials
- Figure S1: boxplot with quantification of parasites with two different protocols
- Figure S2: correlation matrix for the five color variables (in yearlings and adults)
- Table S4: Number of individuals per year for each data set
- Table S5: Variance inflation factor to test multicollinearity among the explanatory variables in the three sets of models
